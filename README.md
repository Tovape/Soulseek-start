# Soulseek-start
Auto runs Soulseek and auto hides it into system tray

Instructions:

Move the soulseek batch shortcut to shell:startup (Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)
Move the batch, ps1 and soulseek shortcut into the installation folder of soulseek

Make sure all the shortcuts open by default as minimised

Any contribs appreciated, I'm not very good with ps
